# Computer_Vision_Project
## Project Overview 
This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques for the classification, detection, and recognition of various marine animals. By utilizing state-of-the-art AI models, this project contributes to efforts in fishing, endangered animal protection, tracking, and analysis.

Project Objectives
Image Classification: Identify the marine animal in a given image.
Object Detection: Localize different instances of the same species within a single image.
Few-Shot Learning (Siamese Network): Recognize specific instances of a certain sea animal, focusing on whales.
